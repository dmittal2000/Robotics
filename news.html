<h3><b>Robotic thread is designed to slip through the brain's blood vessels</b></h3>
<p style="font-size:17px">-->> MIT engineers have developed a magnetically steerable, thread-like robot that can actively glide through narrow, winding pathways, such as the labrynthine vasculature of the brain.<br>-->> In the future, this robotic thread may be paired with existing endovascular technologies, enabling doctors to remotely guide the robot through a patient's brain vessels to quickly treat blockages and lesions, such as those that occur in aneurysms and stroke.<br>-->> Over the past few years, the team has built up expertise in both hydrogels -- biocompatible materials made mostly of water -- and 3-D-printed magnetically-actuated materials that can be designed to crawl, jump, and even catch a ball, simply by following the direction of a magnet.</p>

<h3><b>Self-folding 'Rollbot' paves the way for fully untethered soft robots</b></h3>
<p style="font-size:17px">The majority of soft robots today rely on external power and control, keeping them tethered to off-board systems or rigged with hard components. Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Caltech have developed soft robotic systems, inspired by origami, that can move and change shape in response to external stimuli, paving the way for fully untethered soft robots.</p>

<h3>A miniature stretchable pump for the next generation of soft robots</h3>
<p style="font-size:17px">Soft robots have a distinct advantage over their rigid forebears: they can adapt to complex environments, handle fragile objects and interact safely with humans. Made from silicone, rubber or other stretchable polymers, they are ideal for use in rehabilitation exoskeletons and robotic clothing. Soft bio-inspired robots could one day be deployed to explore remote or dangerous environments.</p>

<h3>HUMANOID ROBOT</h3>
<p style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)" target="_blank"><b>Sophia</b></a> is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016, and made its first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. It is able to display more than 50 facial expressions.</p>

<h3>Sophia's History</h3>
<p style="font-size:17px">Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016. The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn, is known for human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition. Sophia also imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather). Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics. The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.</p>
